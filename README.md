# PEImportTableModifier
A small header-only library which can be used to modify the import table of any PE file. \
Doing that a PE file (e.g. an .exe) will load your custom DLL upon start without any anti-virus program interfering compared to the usual DLL injection mechanisms. 

There is an example project which shows how to use the library.

## Setup
